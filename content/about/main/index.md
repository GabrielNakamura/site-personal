 I was born in Brazil and obtained my master’s in Ecology and Conservation at Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, investigating organization patterns of stream fish communities. I moved from the central to the south region of Brazil to earn my Ph.D. in Ecology at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. During my Ph.D. I developed numerical methods to capture patterns related to the diversity of ecological assemblages. Instead of fishes as a study model, I began to tackle biological and evolutionary questions using virtual species generated inside the cores of computers. Currently, my research program consists in developing quantitative tools to measure patterns and processes that create and maintain biodiversity in space and time. I’m also interested in quantifying gaps in knowledge in different dimensions of biodiversity (shortfalls) and understanding systemic bias in ecological research to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity in science.
