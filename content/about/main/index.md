  I obtained my master degree in Ecology and Conservation at Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, in which I investigated organization patterns in stream fish communities. I moved from central to the south region of Brazil to realize my Ph.D in Ecology at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. Under the supervision of Professor Leandro Duarte, and in a moment that I can not remember, I see myself investigating theoretical questions and developing numerical methods to capture patterns related to the diversity of ecological communities. Instead fishes as study model, I started to investigated virtual species generated in an environment much different from stream landscapes. Nowadays, my fieldwork consisted mainly to go inside the landscapes of computer cores, to investigate the effectiveness of  numerical methods and diversity index to capture patterns of ecological communities. Transform questions and concepts into numbers consist in my main interest. Despite present myself as a community ecologist, my interests also extends to macroevolutionary and data analysis.
