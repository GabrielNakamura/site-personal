 Hi :hand: my name is Gabriel Nakamura. I am a Brazilian ecologist trying to understand the historical and contemporary mechanisms influencing the distribution of species. For this, I rely on the development of numerical methods in community ecology and macroevolution :computer:. I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute of Science and Technology, based at the Universidade Federal de Goi√°s. I'm also associate editor of [Austral Ecology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14429993).
