# Abstract

Patterns of species replacement and richness differences along environmental gradients or ecoregions shed light on different ecological and evolutionary mechanisms acting on community structure. Communities of aquatic ecosystems of different watersheds are supposed to host distinct species and lineages. Quantifying and understanding the degree to which these differences are affected by environmental and biogeographical factors remains an open question for these environments, particularly in the Neotropical region. We investigated patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of headwater streams of the Paraná and Paraguai River basins to understand how local and biogeographical factors affect the assembly of fish communities. We also quantified taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity by decomposing them into nestedness and turnover components. We found that local environmental factors are the main factors influencing the composition of stream fish communities. Whereas pH affected both taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover, water velocity was responsible for phylogenetic turnover and pH was the main driver of phylogenetic nestedness. Our results indicate an effect of local environmental factors in determining the structure of headwater stream fish communities through a combination of a species sorting mechanism (water velocity and pH) and phylogenetic habitat filtering (pH).
