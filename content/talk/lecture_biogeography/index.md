## Bridging the gap among community phylogenetics, biogeography and macroevolution: moving from patterns to process
  
### Outline
  
Detect patterns of biodiversity distribution essential in Community
ecology and Biogeography studies, since patterns allows test hypotheses
and search for the processes generating those patterns. However, this
pattern-oriented approach have not shown adequate to understand the
underlying processes in a given assemblage, since similar patterns can
be generated by totally different evolutionary processes, and the
contrary, very different patterns could be generated by the same
ecological/macroevolutionary process.

In this presentation I will show how we can improve our capacity to
detect unanbiguous patterns and processes generating the distribution of
biological diversity, with a special focus on the analysis of two very
popular metrics used in biogeography and conservation studies: [Phylogenetic Diversity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320792912013)
and [Phylogenetic Endemism](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04311.x).

I will demonstrate that by ignoring deep-time events that occurred in
the evolutionary history of lineages lead to wrong conclusions about the
processes affecting the assembly of communities and biogeographical
regions. Further, I will propose a methodological solution to this
problem that will pave the way to the development of a new family of
metrics of phylogenetic diversity able to differentiate the effects of
two main processes responsible to shape the distribution of life on
earth: historical dispersal and diversification.
