# Abstract

Among the oldest winged insects, odonates are a monophyletic order that have become important models for ecological studies because of their highly diverse reproductive behaviors and their role as top predators and bioindicators. However, knowledge on evolutionary relationships within the order is still scarce compared to other taxa, and this situation is even more complicated in areas with high biodiversity, such as in the Amazon. Here, we sought to identify knowledge gaps on Amazonian Odonata regarding three main aspects: (i) how the inclusion of Amazonian taxa affects our interpretation of the evolutionary relationships of Zygoptera and Anisoptera; (ii) the position of Amazonian taxa in the existing supertree of the Odonata; (iii) dating evolutionary divergence between nodes using fossil records; (iv) assessing whether more species-rich basins (e.g., Amazon basin) have a larger phylogenetic gap when compared to basins with lower richness in South and Central America; and (v) in the light of our knowledge, we discuss diversification patterns found in the most predominant clades of Amazonian taxa. We built a supertree from currently available phylogenetic information of Odonata. The results show that there is no genetic information for 85% (n: 503) of the Amazonian species and that family level relationships are unknown for 17 genera. After compiling the data, we observed that clades belonging to Neotropical lineages are the most poorly resolved, with large polytomies. This problem was identified in many Anisoptera genera, such as Macrothemis, Dasythemis, Elasmothemis, and Erythrodiplax. Our results also suggest that not always the richest basins have the greatest phylogenetic gaps. As expected, we found important gaps in the existing Odonata phylogenies, especially in clades that include Amazonian representatives, that are also those less known from ecological and conservation perspectives
